If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided  you with your sign-in credentials. I want to view my access keys After you create your IAM user access keys, you can view your access key ID at any time. However,  you can't view your secret access key again. If you lose your secret key, you must create a new  access key pair. Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and  a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). Like a  user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to  authenticate your requests. Manage your access keys as securely as you do your user name and  password. Important Do not provide your access keys to a third party, even to help ﬁnd your canonical user ID.\",\n",
